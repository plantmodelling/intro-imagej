## What are stacks? 

Stacks are pile of images. They are vectors of 2D matrices, so can be seen as 3D matrices. The third dimension can take different values. 

## Stacks with different wavelength

Color stacks are formed of 3 matrices, each one tacking a color channel value (RGB or HSV)

## Stacks with different type of informations

Different layers contained different information. For instance, the first one can contain the original image, and the second can have only the contours.

	> Image > Duplicate
	> Binary > Make Binary
	> Analyse > Analyse particules.. (show = Outline)
	> Image > Stacks > Images to stack

## Stacks with different Z positon

The different layers represent the thrid dimension in space. The stack in the case is a volume. ImageJ has some buit-in utilities to render the 3D stack in volume.

## Stacks with different time

These stacks are movies. Each slice is a time point.

## Using stacks to work on several images

If all the images of interest are open as a single stack, any operation done on the displayed image will be perfomed on all the images contained into the slack


## Importing images in a single stack

	> File > Import > Image sequence

This will open all the images and load them all in memory. Can be slow for large stacks of large images


	> File > Import > TIFF virtual stack

This will only open the active image, once at a time.
