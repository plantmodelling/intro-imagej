## What are stacks? 

Stacks are pile of images. They are vectors of 2D matrices, so can be seen as 3D matrices. The third dimension can take different values

### Wavelength

Color stacks are formed of 3 matrices, each one tacking a color channel value (RGB or HSV)

### Different type of information

Different layers contained different information. For instance, the first one can contain the original image, and the second can have only the contours
