# Image analysis pipeline


Image analysis is only one of the step in the global data analysis pipeline:

1. Image acquisition
2. Image analysis
3. Data analysis


Sometimes it is easier to improve previous or future steps rather than spend too much time on the image analysis in itself...



# Improve image acquisition

- Better lighting conditions

- Keep same disctance between camera and object

- Increase contrast between background and object

- Reduce the number of artefact in the object

- Try different sensors (visible, infrared, multispectral)

# Improve image analysis

- Calibrate your pipeline

- Find a robust ground-truth dataset
	- manual measurements
	- simulated images
   
- Estimate the error

# Improve data processing

- Filter out noisy data

- Correctly identify outlyers
